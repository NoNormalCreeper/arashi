## Contribute


The ```dev``` branch is Arashi's development branch, which is not open to anyone because of the painful experience of being ```git push -f``` before.

If you want to participate in the development of Arashi, please fork this warehouse first, and then submit a Pull Request to ```arashi:dev``` of this warehouse after your warehouse is modified.

Please make sure your commit is standardized, and the code style is consistent with the existing code of the project. Thank you for your contribution to Arashi.
